Dear Principal,

I am writing to request a leave of absence from school for [number] days, starting from [date] to [date], as I am currently unwell and need to take some time to recover.

Unfortunately, I have been suffering from [mention the illness or symptoms, e.g., fever, flu, etc.], which has made it difficult for me to attend classes and participate in school activities. I am undergoing treatment and following the advice of my doctor, who has recommended that I take a few days off to rest and recover.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and will make sure to catch up on any missed work as soon as I am feeling better. I will provide a medical certificate from my doctor, if required, to support my leave.

I appreciate your understanding and approval in this matter. If there is anything I can do to mitigate the impact of my absence, please let me know.

Thank you for your support and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
