Dear Music Enthusiast,

I'd be delighted to craft a song just for you! However, I need a bit more information to make it truly special. Could you please tell me:

* What's your favorite genre of music (e.g., pop, rock, acoustic, etc.)?
* Is there a particular theme or topic you'd like the song to be about (e.g., love, motivation, friendship, etc.)?
* Do you have a specific tone in mind (e.g., upbeat, melancholic, inspirational, etc.)?
* Is there a particular artist or band that inspires you?

Once I have a better understanding of your preferences, I'll get creative and pen a song that resonates with you!

Looking forward to hearing back from you and crafting a melody that speaks to your heart.

Best regards,
