Dear ChirayuBM,

As I gaze upon the celestial sea, 
A twinkling tapestry, infinite and free, 
The stars, like diamonds, sparkle bright and fair, 
A whispered promise, beyond mortal care.

Their gentle twinkling, a soft serenade, 
Echoes of a beauty yet unafraid, 
A heavenly showcase, of light and might, 
A dance of wonder, on this darkest night.

Like ancient friends, they guide and light the way, 
Through the vast expanse, of a endless day, 
Their soft luminescence, a beacon bright, 
Illuminating dreams, and the dark of night.

Oh, stars above, you whisper secrets old, 
Of a universe, where mysteries unfold, 
A language of light, that only a few can hear, 
A celestial music, that echoes, year by year.

As I stand in awe, beneath your twinkling might, 
I am reminded, of the beauty and the light, 
That shines within, and guides me on my way, 
A reflection of the stars, that shine each day.

Best regards,
