Here is a sample sick leave letter to a principal:

Dear Principal [Principal's Name],

I am writing to inform you that I will be unable to attend school for the next [number of days] days due to health reasons. Unfortunately, I am currently unwell and am under doctor's orders to take some time to rest and recover.

I am suffering from [briefly mention your illness, e.g. fever, flu, etc.]. My doctor has advised me to take [number of days] days off from school to ensure a speedy recovery. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and will do my best to catch up on any missed work as soon as I am feeling better.

I will make sure to provide a medical certificate from my doctor if required. If there is any urgent work that needs my attention in the meantime, please let me know and I will do my best to complete it remotely.

Thank you for your understanding and support during this time.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
