Dear [Manager's Name],

I am writing to request a sick leave for [number of days] days, starting from [date] to [date], as I am currently unwell and unable to attend work.

Unfortunately, I am suffering from [briefly mention your illness or symptoms, e.g., fever, flu, etc.]. My doctor has advised me to take some time off to rest and recover, and I will need to take this leave to ensure a speedy recovery.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and will make sure to catch up on any missed work as soon as I am feeling better. I will keep you updated on my status and provide a doctor's note if required.

Thank you for your understanding and support during this time.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
